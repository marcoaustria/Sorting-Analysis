# Sorting-Analysis
Project for COP3530 Data Structures and Algorithms

ASSIGNMENT:

Implement two sorting routines of your choice. 

Create input files of four sizes: 5000, 10000, 20000, and 50000 integers with one integer per line. 

For each size file make 3 versions. 

One version will be randomly ordered, one version will be in descending order, and one version will be in ascending order. 

This means you have a set of 12 input files. 

Run each sort against all input files. 

Thus, you will run average case, worst case (descending) and best case (ascending). 

For each run, access the system clock to get time values. 

Turn in a commentary comparing the two sorts and their performance. 

Comment on the relative run times, the effect of the order of the data, and the size of the files. 

Include plots of run time versus file size. 

Comment on the indicated computational complexity. 

Time the sorts several times and get an average.
